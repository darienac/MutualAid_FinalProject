## Introduction

*Strength in Solidarity!* 🌟\
\
**MutualAid** facilitates community engagement by connecting neighbors in need with those who can donate time and resources in-kind.  In response to community needs such as natural disasters and humanitarian crises, **MutualAid** promotes social justice among those directly impacted, empowering individuals instead of solely relying on external organizations.

### Purpose
Our app empowers users to connect, share, and offer support for those in need in their community. It is a platform where neighbors can support each other through mutual aid, providing the tools needed for efficient collaboration during times of crisis and everyday challenges.

### Target Audience
MutualAid is designed for urban, suburban, and rural neighborhoods, serving:
- Residents seeking assistance or offering help.
- Volunteers eager to contribute time and resources.
- Grassroots organizations committed to self-empowerment, community-based action, and inclusivity.
